            <h2>About Lucas</h2>
            <p>Lucas has a <a href="#!" class="audio-proof">busy schedule</a>. Between his nine-to-five job and the ongoing renovations in his house, he does not have a lot of free time to work with. He won't settle for a job with a company that isn't as innovative and cutting edge as she believes she deserves. She wants to get the most out of every professional experience, and before moving to a new position, Rosa investigates every angle of aligning herself with a company.</p>

                <li>Wants to figure out how to get in touch with someone at the company to explore opportunities further.</li>
            </ul>

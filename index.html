            <h2>About Lucas</h2>
            <p>Lucas has a <a href="#!" class="audio-proof">busy life</a>. Between his nine-to-five job and the ongoing renovations in his house, he does not have a lot of free time to work with. He won't settle for beers that simply are 'okay' or ones he has drank plenty of times &mdash; he's actively searching for fresh, new ales to try.</p>

                <li>Would like to challenge herself and have a more stable job, but is comfortable as a freelancer and wouldn't stop for just any job.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Needs to see reasons why a company is interesting: has it won awards, had intense growth, won big contracts?</li>
                <li>Wants to figure out how to get in touch with someone at the company to explore opportunities further.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Tasks</h2>

                <li>Explore different beers and their pricing.</li>
                <li>Read press releases about recent big contract wins and other accolades.</li>
                <li>Read about culture, benefits and perks, and the people that work there.</li>

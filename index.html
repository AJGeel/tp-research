            <div class="quote audible" id="q_01" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">I don't have a lot of opportunities to try different brews.. So when I buy something, it better be good. <img src="i/audio-fill.png"/></div>
            <div class="quote audible" id="q_02">I enjoy variety in the types of beers I drink. I like the relaxing aspect of deconstructing flavours after a stressful day at work. <img src="i/audio-fill.png"/></div>

            <h2>About Lucas</h2>
            <p>Lucas has a <a href="#!" class="audible" id="q_03">busy life <img src="i/audio-fill.png"/>.</a> Between his nine-to-five job and the ongoing renovations in his house, he does not have a lot of free time to work with. He won't settle for beers that simply are 'okay' or ones he has drank plenty of times &mdash; he's actively searching for fresh, new ales to try.</p>

            <h2>Behavioural Considerations</h2>
            <ul class="characteristics">
                <li>Expects the site experience to reflect the business's culture and values.</li>
                <li>Sometimes has guests over, should also have some 'mainstream' brews that 'non-connaisseurs' may appreciate.</li>
                <li>Thoroughly compares multiple breweries with similar products.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <h2>Frustrations</h2>
            <ul class="characteristics">
                <li>Thinks that the mainstream production of special beers devalue the range of available beers. Big breweries cater to the common denominator, innovation in brewing hardly happens.</li>
                <li>Has no time for mediocre beers, as he only has limited opportunities to engage in tasting sessions with his peers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <ul class="characteristics">
                <li>Needs to see reasons why the beers are interesting to him: have they won awards, had good PR, gets the community interested?</li>
                <li>Wants to save the hassle of endlessly browsing with minimal results. Expects to receive a quality product every time.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Tasks</h2>
            <ul class="characteristics">
                <li>Explore different beers and see how much they cost.</li>
                <li>Read about the brand's culture, identity and employees: who actually create the beers, and why should he care?</li>
                <li>Purchase beers efficiently, and have a fast shipping- or pickup fulfilment system.</li>
            </ul>

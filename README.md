# Transformative Practices — Research Project

Welcome to the repository for my Master 1.2 Research Project at the TU/e. 

Within the Transformative Practices framework by Hummels and Lévy, I am looking into the status quo of user research within the professional design space. 

This repository contains demonstrator deliverables utilised in a series of 'Constructive Design Research' field tests.
